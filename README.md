## Node Examples for Geeny

This repository contains all the examples for the Getting Started with Formula Development

## Dependencies (Local Development)

First you will need a suitable version of NodeJS. We use
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to control our NodeJS version. To install
and run dependencies using nvm.

```
cd Step-1
nvm use v8.4.0
npm install
node app.js
```

By default the `app.js` will use the port 80, which is normally by the OS.

## Dependencies (Docker Development)

To run the HelloWorld application, you must have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
installed.

At Geeny, we use Docker Edge 17.0.*, and this is the version we have used in our
tests. Other versions are not guaranteed to work with this tutorial.

We also use [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose) to more easily
declare our app dependencies at the infrastructure level.

To run your service locally, you can run:

```
cd Step-1
docker-compose build && docker-compose up
```

The `docker-compose.yml` file conveniently re-maps the exposed port from the 80 (used
by Geeny) to 3000

Now visit http://localhost:3000 and the example should be running there.
